# diligent

The most transparent, yet the most diligent coding agent.

## Principles

1. **Transparency over complexity** — Agents are inherently complex. Without transparency, development becomes increasingly difficult. Keep things simple so every layer can be debugged, experimented with, measured, verified, and improved — continuously.
2. **When everything is "important," nothing is** — The agent harness should not try to do everything. Find the few moves that truly matter.

## Status

Research complete. Entering architecture design.
