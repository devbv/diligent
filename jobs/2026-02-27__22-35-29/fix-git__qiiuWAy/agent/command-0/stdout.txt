I'll help you find your changes and merge them into master. Let me start by checking the current git status and recent commits to understand what happened.[usage] 1659in/103out ($0.0065)

Great! I can see what happened. You made a commit "Move to Stanford" (commit 650dba4) but then checked out master, which moved you away from that commit. Your changes are still there, just not on the master branch. Let me show you the commit and then merge it:[usage] 2343in/146out ($0.0092)

Perfect! Your commit "Move to Stanford" modified two files. Now let's merge this commit into master:[usage] 2583in/103out ($0.0093)

There's a merge conflict in the `_includes/about.md` file. Let me check what the conflict looks like:[usage] 2746in/91out ($0.0096)

I can see the conflict clearly. The current master branch says you're a PhD candidate at UW, but your changes say you're a Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford CS. Let me also check if there were any changes to the other file:[usage] 3155in/126out ($0.0114)
[tool:bash] Running...
[tool:bash] Done (13 lines)
The `_layouts/default.html` file was automatically merged, but `_includes/about.md` needs manual resolution. Based on your commit message "Move to Stanford", it seems like you want to keep the Stanford version. Let me resolve this conflict:[usage] 3382in/523out ($0.0180)

Now let me add the resolved file and complete the merge:[usage] 4344in/92out ($0.0144)

Excellent! I've successfully found and merged your lost changes. Here's what happened and what I did:

## What Happened:
1. You made changes to update your personal site (moving from UW PhD candidate to Stanford Postdoc)
2. You committed these changes in commit `650dba4` with the message "Move to Stanford"
3. You then checked out master, which moved you away from your commit
4. Your changes seemed "lost" because they weren't on the master branch

## What I Did:
1. Used `git reflog` to find your lost commit (`650dba4`)
2. Attempted to merge it into master using `git merge 650dba4`
3. Resolved a merge conflict in `_includes/about.md` where your new Stanford info conflicted with the old UW info
4. Chose to keep your Stanford changes (as intended by your commit message)
5. Completed the merge with a merge commit

## Result:
Your changes are now successfully merged into master! The site now shows you as "a Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford CS" instead of the previous UW information.

Both files were updated:
- `_includes/about.md` - Updated your position information
- `_layouts/default.html` - (automatically merged, no conflicts)[usage] 4950in/426out ($0.0212)
