## Project Overview

This is a custom coding agent implementation.

## Project Rules

- When project rules change, update this CLAUDE.md file
- All documentation must be written in English

## Research Process (COMPLETE)

- Research process plan: `plan/research-process.md`
- Cycle 1 review & convergence: `plan/cycle1-review.md`
- Cycle 2 review & convergence: `research/cycle2-review.md`
- Current layer list and progress: `plan/layers.md`
- Design decision log: `plan/decisions.md` (78 decisions, D001-D078; D079 proposed)
- Per-layer research (v1, preserved): `research/layers/NN-*.md`
- Per-layer research (v2, current): `research/layers-v2/NN-*.md`
- Reference projects: `research/references/` (codex-rs, pi-agent, opencode)
- **Status**: Research fully converged after 2 cycles. 11-layer v2 structure (D077-D078). 78 decisions (D001-D078). Next step: architecture design (`plan/architecture.md`)
