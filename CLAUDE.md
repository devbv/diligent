## Project Rules

- When project rules change, update this CLAUDE.md file
- All documentation must be written in English

## Research Process (COMPLETE)

- Research process plan: `plan/research-process.md`
- Cycle 1 review & convergence: `plan/cycle1-review.md`
- Cycle 2 review & convergence: `research/cycle2-review.md`
- Current layer list and progress: `plan/layers.md`
- Design decision log: `plan/decisions.md` (78 decisions, D001-D078; D079 proposed)
- Per-layer research: `research/layers/NN-*.md`
- Reference projects (external sources): `research/references/`
- LLM tools research: `research/llm-tools/`
- OpenClaw analysis: `research/openclaw/`
- Side research: `research/side-research/`
- Implementation phases (layers vs phases analysis): `plan/implementation-phases.md`
- **Status**: Research fully converged after 2 cycles. 11-layer v2 structure (D077-D078). 78 decisions (D001-D078). Next step: architecture design (`plan/architecture.md`)
