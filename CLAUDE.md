# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

This is a custom coding agent implementation.

## Project Rules

- When project rules change, update this CLAUDE.md file
- All documentation and file contents must be written in *English* even if the user writes in a different language.
- Never start implementation until requirements are fully understood. Keep asking questions relentlessly until there is zero ambiguity — no assumptions, no guessing

## Testing

- After any code change, always run unit tests: `bun test` (scans `packages/` via bunfig.toml `root`)
- E2E tests (`packages/e2e/`) hit the real Anthropic API — run only when explicitly requested: `bun run test:e2e`

## Implementation

- Implementation plans live in `plan/impl/`. Always read the relevant phase plan before starting implementation.
- Design decisions are in `plan/decisions.md`. Reference decision IDs (e.g. D001) when implementing.
- Layer architecture is in `research/layers/*`. Understand layer dependencies before cross-layer work.
