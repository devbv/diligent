## Pending

- [ ] **Add context budget management for compaction** — Context compaction fails when the context window is completely full (no room to run the compaction itself). The agent needs to reserve ~20% of the context window as headroom so compaction can always be triggered before it's too late. Investigate the right threshold and implement a proactive compaction strategy. (added: 2026-02-25)
